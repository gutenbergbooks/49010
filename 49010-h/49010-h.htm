<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="62" height="75" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE good fortune which has attended
the earlier edition of this book is a proof
that there is less occasion now than
formerly to plead the cause of fables for use
in elementary schools. And yet their value is
still too little recognized. The homely wisdom,
which the fables represent so aptly, was a more
common possession of intelligent people of a
generation or two ago than it is at the present
time. It had then a better chance of being
passed on by natural tradition than is now the
case among the less homogeneous parentage
of our school children. And there has never
been a greater need than now for the kind of
seed-sowing for character that is afforded by
this means. As in the troubled times in Greece
in Æsop’s day, twenty-five centuries ago, moral
teaching to be salutary must be largely shorn
of didactic implications and veiled with wit
and satire. This insures its most vital working
wherever its teaching is pertinent. To be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
whipped, warned, shamed, or encouraged, and
so corrected, over the heads of animals as they
are represented in the expression of their
native traits, is the least offensive way that can
fall to a person’s lot. Among several hundred
episodes, knowledge of which is acquired in
childhood as a part of an educational routine,
most conservative estimates would allow for
large, substantial results in practical wit and
wisdom, to be reaped as later life calls for them.</p>

<p>It is well recognized by scholars, and should
be taught to children, that not all the fables
attributed to Æsop are of so early a date.
Imitations of his genius all along the centuries
have masqueraded under his name. Facts
about him appear in the Introduction.</p>

<p>No occasion has been found to change in
this edition the style of presentation so highly
approved in the original one; but, as a considerable
number of the stories, especially in the
earlier pages of the book, are amplified somewhat
in language form to accommodate them
to the needs of children unfamiliar with the
animals portrayed, it has been thought wise to
present these in the briefer form in which they
are generally known to adult readers. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
are to be found in an Appendix to the present
volume. The ingenious teacher will find numerous
ways in which this duplication of
stories may be turned to account. Comparison
of the two forms will suggest many exercises
to be performed by the pupils themselves,
in which the longer forms of the fables
may be built up from the shorter forms, and
vice versa. The teacher who is interested in
dramatic work will find also that many of the
fables will make excellent material for dramatic
presentation in the classroom.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>THE HISTORY OF FABLE</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="84" height="75" alt="M" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MODERN versions of Æsop go back
no further than 480 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> In their
earliest use they are related to the
folklore current among all primitive peoples.
This folklore had risen in Greece to the rank
of literary form a thousand years before the
above-mentioned revival in Germany, France,
and England. As the creation of Æsop it was
the answer to a need for trenchant, but veiled,
characterization of men and measures in the
dangerous times of the Tyrants. In mirth-provoking
utterances, quite apart from personal
criticism, things could be intimated
with all the force of specific judgments, yet
in such veiled form that to resent them was
tacit confession that they applied. Later on,
when free speech became safer, the grammarians
and rhetoricians raised these clever,
pithy stories to the literary form they have
since maintained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>There is for Æsop’s Fables no authorized
original version. Always, it appears, they
were subject to interpolations and special versions.
They took on metrical forms in Latin,
and in later times in French. It is the particular
distinction of a real fable that it bears this
amplification, yet can at any time and from
any true version shake off the accessories of
particular phrasing and in its bare facts meet
all the requirements of a literary and artistic
whole. It is this static character which has
made the fable of such value to language
students. Even little children, comparing different
versions, learn to distinguish the raw
material of a real story from its varying renderings.
Subjoined is an account of Æsop,
called the Inventor and Father of Fable in its
present form.</p>


<h3>ÆSOP, THE FATHER OF THE FABLE</h3>

<p>The life of Æsop, like that of Homer, the
most famous of Greek poets, is involved in
much obscurity. Sardis, the capital of Lydia;
Samos, a Greek island; Mesembria, an ancient
colony in Thrace; and Cotiæum, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
chief city of a province of Phrygia, contend
for the distinction of being his birthplace.
Although the honor thus claimed cannot be
definitely assigned to any one of these places,
yet there are a few incidents now generally
accepted by scholars as established facts relating
to the birth, life, and death of Æsop.
He is, by an almost universal consent, allowed
to have been born about the year 620 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> and
to have been by birth a slave. He was owned
by two masters in succession, Xanthus and
Jadmon, both inhabitants of Samos, the latter
of whom gave him his liberty as a reward for
his learning and wit. One of the privileges of
a freedman in the ancient republics of Greece
was the permission to take an active interest
in public affairs; and Æsop, like the philosophers
Phædo, Menippus, and Epictetus in
later times, raised himself from the indignity
of a servile condition to a position of high
renown. In his desire alike to instruct and to
be instructed, he traveled through many countries,
and among others came to Sardis, the
capital of the famous king of Lydia, the great
patron, in that day, of learning and of learned
men. At the court of Crœsus he met with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Solon, Thales, and other sages, and is related
so to have pleased his royal master by the
part he took in the conversations held with
these philosophers that Crœsus applied to him
an expression which has since passed into a
proverb—μαλλον ὁ Φρὑξ, “The Phrygian has
spoken better than all.”</p>

<p>On the invitation of Crœsus he fixed his
residence at Sardis, and was employed by that
monarch in various difficult and delicate affairs
of state. In his discharge of these commissions
he visited the different petty republics of
Greece. At one time he is found in Corinth,
and at another in Athens, endeavoring, by the
narration of some of his wise fables, to reconcile
the inhabitants of those cities to the administration
of their rulers. One of these
missions, undertaken at the command of Crœsus,
was the occasion of his death. Having
been sent to Delphi with a large sum of gold
for distribution among the citizens, he was so
indignant at their covetousness that he refused
to divide the money and sent it back to his
master. The Delphians, enraged at this treatment,
accused him of impiety and, in spite of
his sacred character as ambassador, executed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
him as a public criminal. But the great fabulist
did not lack posthumous honors, for a
statue was erected to his memory at Athens,
the work of Lysippus, one of the most famous
of Greek sculptors. These few facts are all
that can be relied on with any degree of certainty
in reference to the birth, life, and death
of Æsop.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fable on pages 197-200 is a translation
of La Fontaine’s metrical version of one of
the most popular of the Æsop Fables. La
Fontaine, who died at Paris in 1695, was a
popular writer of drama and the most noted
of the French fabulists. Following this, on
pages 201-214, are fables from the Russian of
Kriloff, a writer who for nearly twenty years
was one of the librarians at the Imperial
Public Library at St. Petersburg, in which
city he died in 1844.</p>

<h2>THE WOLF AND THE LAMB</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-o.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day a Wolf and a Lamb
happened to come at the same
time to drink from a brook
that ran down the side of the mountain.</p>

<p>The Wolf wished very much to eat
the Lamb, but meeting her as he did,
face to face, he thought he must find
some excuse for doing so.</p>

<p>So he began by trying to pick a
quarrel, and said angrily: “How dare
you come to my brook and muddy
the water so that I cannot drink it?
What do you mean?”</p>

<p>The Lamb, very much alarmed, said
gently: “I do not see how it can be that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
I have spoiled the water. You stand
higher up the stream, and the water
runs from you to me, not from me to
you.”</p>

<p>“Be that as it may,” said the Wolf,
with a snarl, “you are a rascal all the
same, for I have heard that last year
you said bad things of me behind
my back.”</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. Wolf,” cried the poor
Lamb, “that could not be, for a year
ago I was not born; I am only six
months old.”</p>

<p>Finding it of no use to argue any
more, the Wolf began to snarl and
show his teeth. Coming closer to the
Lamb, he said, “You little wretch, if it
was not you it was your father, so it’s
all the same”; and he pounced upon the
poor Lamb and ate her up.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE FOX AND THE LION</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;LITTLE fox was out playing
one day, when a Lion came
roaring along. “Dear me,”
said the Fox, as he hid behind a tree,
“I never saw a Lion before. What a
terrible creature! His voice makes me
tremble.”</p>

<p>The next time the Fox met the Lion
he was not so much afraid, but he kept
a safe distance and said to himself,
“I wish he would not make such a
noise!”</p>

<p>The third time they met, the Fox
was not frightened at all. He ran up
to the Lion, and said, “What are you
roaring about?”</p>

<p>And the Lion was so taken by surprise
that, without saying a word, he
let the Fox walk away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>It would not be safe for little
foxes always to follow the example
of this one; but it is often true that
what our fear makes seem a lion in
the way has no danger in it if we
meet it bravely.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE DOG AND HIS SHADOW</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;DOG once had a nice piece of
meat for his dinner. Some
say that it was stolen, but
others, that it had been given him
by a butcher, which we hope was
the case.</p>

<p>Dogs like best to eat at home, and
he went trotting along with the meat
in his mouth, as happy as a king.</p>

<p>On the dog’s way there was a
stream with a plank across it. As the
water was still and clear, he stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to take a look at it. What should
he see, as he gazed into its bright
depths, but a dog as big as himself,
looking up at him, and lo! the dog
had meat in his mouth.</p>

<p>“I’ll try to get that,” said he; “then
with both mine and his what a feast
I shall have!” As quick as thought he
snapped at the meat, but in doing so
he had to open his mouth, and his
own piece fell to the bottom of the
stream.</p>

<p>Then he saw that the other dog had
lost his piece, too. He went sadly
home. In trying to grasp a shadow
he lost his substance.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE CRAB AND HIS MOTHER</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-mquote.jpg" width="106" height="75" alt="M" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“MY child,” said a Crab to
her son, “why do you walk
so awkwardly? If you
wish to make a good appearance, you
should go straight forward, and not
to one side as you do so constantly.”</p>

<p>“I do wish to make a good
appearance, mamma,” said the young
Crab; “and if you will show me how,
I will try to walk straight forward.”</p>

<p>“Why, this is the way, of course,”
said the mother, as she started off to
the right. “No, this is the way,” said
she, as she made another attempt, to
the left.</p>

<p>The little Crab smiled. “When
you learn to do it yourself, you can
teach me,” he said, and went back to
his play.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE FOX AND THE GRAPES</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="29" height="75" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT WAS a sultry day, and a Fox
was almost famishing with hunger
and thirst. He was just saying
to himself that anything would be
acceptable to him, when, looking up,
he spied some great clusters of ripe,
black grapes hanging from a trellised
vine.</p>

<p>“What luck!” he said; “if only
they weren’t quite so high, I should
be sure of a fine feast. I wonder if
I can get them. I can think of
nothing that would so refresh me.”</p>

<p>Jumping into the air is not the
easiest thing in the world for a Fox
to do; but he gave a great spring
and nearly reached the lowest clusters.</p>

<p>“I’ll do better next time,” he said.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/illus030.jpg" width="321" height="500" alt="fox trying to reach grapes" />
</div>

<p>He tried again and again, but did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a><br /><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
not succeed so well as at first. Finding
that he was losing his strength
and that he had little chance of getting
the grapes, he walked slowly off,
grumbling as he did so: “The grapes
are sour, and not at all fit for my
eating. I’ll leave them to the greedy
birds. They eat anything.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE WOLF AND THE CRANE</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-o.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day a Wolf, who was
eating his dinner much too
fast, swallowed a bone, which
stuck in his throat and pained him
very much. He tried to get it out,
but could not.</p>

<p>Just then he saw a Crane passing
by. “Dear friend,” said he to the
Crane, “there is a bone sticking in
my throat. You have a good long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
neck; can’t you reach down and pull it
out? I will pay you well for it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” said the Crane. Then he
put his head into the Wolf’s mouth,
between his sharp teeth, and reaching
down, pulled out the bone.</p>

<p>“There!” said the Wolf, “I am
glad it is out; I must be more careful
another time.”</p>

<p>“I will go now, if you will pay
me,” said the Crane.</p>

<p>“Pay you, indeed!” cried the Wolf.
“Be thankful that I did not bite your
head off when it was in my mouth.
You ought to be content with that.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gentle, kindly folk sometimes have
to learn that kindness must be mixed
with caution.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE ANTS AND THE
GRASSHOPPERS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="62" height="75" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Ants and the Grasshoppers
lived together in the great
field. The Ants were busy all
the time gathering a store of grain
to lay by for winter use. They gave
themselves so little pleasure that their
merry neighbors, the Grasshoppers,
began at last to take scarcely any
notice of them.</p>

<p>When the frost came, it put an end
to the work of the Ants and the
chirping and merrymaking of the
Grasshoppers. But one fine winter’s
day, when the Ants were employed in
spreading their grain in the sun to dry,
a Grasshopper, who was nearly perishing
with hunger, chanced to pass by.</p>

<p>“Good day to you, kind neighbor,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
said she; “will you not lend me a
little food? I will certainly pay you
before this time next year.”</p>

<p>“How does it happen that you have
no food of your own?” asked an old
Ant. “There was an abundance in the
field where we lived side by side all summer,
and your people seemed to be active
enough. What were you doing, pray?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the Grasshopper, forgetting
his hunger, “I sang all the
day long, and all the night, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” interrupted the Ant,
“I must not deprive my own family
for you. If Grasshoppers find it so gay
to sing away the summer, they must
starve in winter,” and she went on
with her work, all the while singing
the old song, “We ants never borrow;
we ants never lend.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE FROGS WHO ASKED
FOR A KING</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="62" height="75" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE were once some Frogs
who lived together in perfect
security in a beautiful lake.
They were a large company, and
were very comfortable, but they came
to think that they might be still
happier if they had a King to rule
over them.</p>

<p>So they sent to Jupiter, their god,
to ask him to give them a King.</p>

<p>Jupiter laughed at their folly, for
he knew that they were better off as
they were; but he said to them,
“Well, here is a King for you,” and
into the water he threw a big Log.</p>

<p>It fell with such a splash that the
Frogs were terrified and hid themselves
in the deep mud under the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>By and by, one braver than the
rest peeped out to look at the King,
and saw the Log, as it lay quietly on
the top of the water. Soon, one after
another they all came out of their
hiding places and ventured to look at
their great King.</p>

<p>As the Log did not move, they
swam round it, keeping a safe distance
away, and at last one by one
hopped upon it.</p>

<p>“This is not a King,” said a wise
old Frog; “it is nothing but a stupid
Log. If we had a King, Jupiter
would pay more attention to us.”</p>

<p>Again they sent to Jupiter, and
begged him to give them a King
who could rule over them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 322px;">
<img src="images/illus037.jpg" width="322" height="500" alt="stork with frog in beak with other frogs around" />
</div>

<p>Jupiter did not like to be disturbed
again by the silly Frogs, and this
time he sent them a Stork, saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a><br /><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
“You will have some one to rule
over you now.”</p>

<p>As they saw the Stork solemnly
walking down to the lake, they were
delighted.</p>

<p>“Ah!” they said, “see how grand
he looks! How he strides along!
How he throws back his head! This is
a King indeed. He shall rule over us,”
and they went joyfully to meet him.</p>

<p>As their new King came nearer, he
paused, stretched out his long neck,
picked up the head Frog, and swallowed
him at one mouthful. And
then the next—and the next!</p>

<p>“What is this?” cried the Frogs,
and they began to draw back in terror.</p>

<p>But the Stork with his long legs
easily followed them to the water, and
kept on eating them as fast as he
could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! if we had only been—” said
the oldest Frog. He was going to add
“content,” but was eaten up before he
could finish the sentence.</p>

<p>The remaining Frogs cried to Jupiter
to help them, but he would not listen.
And the Stork-King ate them for breakfast,
dinner, and supper, every day, till in
a short time there was not a Frog left in
the lake. Poor, foolish Frogs, not to
have known when they were well off.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;DONKEY once put on a Lion’s
skin which some hunters had
spread out to dry. It did not
fit the Donkey very well, but he found
that in it he could frighten all the
timid, foolish little animals, so he
amused himself by chasing them about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>By and by he met a Fox, and tried
to frighten him by roaring.</p>

<p>“My dear Donkey,” said the wise
Fox, “you are braying, and not roaring.
I might, perhaps, have been
frightened by your looks, if you had
not tried to roar; but I know your
voice too well to mistake you for
a Lion.”</p>

<h2>THE MICE IN COUNCIL</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-s.jpg" width="50" height="75" alt="S" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SOME little Mice, who lived in
the walls of a house, met together
one night, to talk of
the wicked Cat and to consider what
could be done to get rid of her. The
head Mice were Brown-back, Gray-ear,
and White-whisker.</p>

<p>“There is no comfort in the house,”
said Brown-back. “If I but step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
into the pantry to pick up a few
crumbs, down comes the Cat, and
I have hardly time to run to my
nest again.”</p>

<p>“What can we do?” asked Gray-ear.
“Shall we all run at her at once and
bite her, and frighten her away?”</p>

<p>“No,” said White-whisker; “she is
so bold we could not frighten her. I
have thought of something better than
that. Let us hang a bell round her
neck. Then, if she moves, the bell
will ring, and we shall hear it, and
have time to run away.”</p>

<p>“O yes! yes!” cried all the Mice.
“That is a capital idea. We will bell the
Cat! Hurrah! hurrah! No more fear
of the Cat!” and they danced in glee.</p>

<p>When their glee had subsided a
little, Brown-back asked, “But who
will hang the bell round her neck?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>No one answered. “Will you?” he
asked of White-whisker.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I can,” replied White-whisker;
“I am lame, you know. It
needs some one who can move quickly.”</p>

<p>“Will you, Gray-ear?” said Brown-back.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” answered Gray-ear;
“I have not been well since that time
when I was almost caught in the
trap.”</p>

<p>“Who will bell the Cat, then?” said
Brown-back. “If it is to be done,
some one must do it.”</p>

<p>Not a sound was heard, and one by
one the little Mice stole away to their
holes, no better off than they were
before.</p>

<p>When there is trouble there is need
of some one to act, as well as some
one to advise.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;KID coming home alone one
night met a big Wolf. “Oh,
oh, I know you will kill me,”
said the little Kid; “but please play
me a tune, so that I may have one
more dance before I die; I am so
fond of dancing.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Wolf, “I will
try, for I should like to see you dance
before I eat you.”</p>

<p>Then the Wolf took up the shepherd’s
pipe that was lying near, and
began to play. But while he was
playing, and the Kid was dancing a
jig, the Dogs heard the sound, and
came running up.</p>

<p>“It is my own fault,” said the Wolf,
as the Dogs caught him. “My business
is to kill Kids and eat them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
not to play for them to dance. Why
did I try to be a Piper, when I am
really only a Butcher?”</p>

said the Kid.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;NIGHTINGALE sitting on
the top of an oak, singing
her evening song, was spied
by a hungry Hawk, who swooped
down and seized her. The frightened
Nightingale prayed the Hawk to let
her go.</p>

<p>“If you are hungry,” said she,
“why not catch some large bird? I am
not big enough for even a luncheon.”</p>

<p>“Do you happen to see many large
birds flying about?” said the Hawk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
“You are the only bird I have seen
to-day, and I should be foolish indeed
to let you go for the sake of larger
birds that are not in sight. A morsel
is better than nothing.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;THIRSTY Crow once spied a
pitcher, and flew to it to
see if by chance there was
any water in it.</p>

<p>When she looked in, she saw that
there was water, but that it was so
far from the top that she could not
reach it, though she stretched her
neck as far as she could.</p>

<p>She stopped, and thought to herself,
“How shall I get that water?
I am perishing with thirst, and there
must be some way for me to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
some of it.” Some pebbles were
lying on the ground; and, picking
them up in her beak, she dropped
them one by one into the pitcher.</p>

<p>They sank to the bottom; and at
last the water was pushed up by
them to the top, so that the Crow
could easily drink it.</p>

<p>“Where there’s a will, there’s a
way,” said the Crow.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE ANT AND THE DOVE</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AN Ant, walking by the river
one day, said to himself,
“How nice and cool this
water looks! I must drink some of
it.” But as he began to drink, his
foot slipped, and he fell in.</p>

<p>“Oh, somebody please help me, or
I shall drown!” cried he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>A Dove, sitting in a tree that overhung
the river, heard him, and threw
him a leaf. “Climb up on that leaf,”
said she, “and you will float ashore.”</p>

<p>The Ant climbed up onto the leaf,
which the wind blew to the shore,
and he stepped upon dry land again.</p>

<p>“Good-by, kind Dove,” said he, as
he ran home. “You have saved my
life, and I wish I could do something
for you.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said the Dove; “be
careful not to fall in again.”</p>

<p>A few days after this, when the
Dove was busy building her nest,
the Ant saw a man just raising his
gun to shoot her.</p>

<p>He ran quickly, and bit the man’s
leg so hard that he cried “Oh! oh!”
and dropped his gun.</p>

<p>This startled the Dove, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
flew away. The man picked up his
gun, and walked on.</p>

<p>When he was gone, the Dove came
back to her nest.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my little friend,” she
said. “You have saved my life.”</p>

<p>And the little Ant was overjoyed to
think he had been able to do for the
Dove what the Dove had so lately
done for him.</p>

<h2>THE OX AND THE FROG</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AN Ox, drinking at a pool,
chanced to set his foot on
a young Frog, and crushed
him to death.</p>

<p>His brothers and sisters, who were
playing near, ran at once to tell their
mother what had happened. “Oh,
Mother,” they cried, “a very huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
beast, with four great feet, came to
the pool, and crushed our brother to
death in an instant, with his hard,
cloven heel.”</p>

<p>The old Frog was very vain. She
was rather large, as Frogs go, and
gave herself airs on account of it.
“Was the cruel beast so very large?”
she said. “How big?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the young Frogs. “It
was a terrible monster!”</p>

<p>“Was it as big as this?” she said,
blowing and puffing herself out.</p>

<p>“Oh, much bigger,” replied the
young Frogs.</p>

<p>“As big as this, then?” she added,
puffing and blowing with all her might.</p>

<p>“A great deal bigger,” they answered.</p>

<p>“Well, was it <i>so</i> big?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother!” cried the Frogs;
“pray do not try to be so big. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
you were to puff till you burst, you
could not make yourself half so big
as the creature we tell you of.”</p>

<p>But the silly old Frog would not
give up. She tried again to puff herself
out, saying, “As big as”—and
she did indeed burst.</p>

<p>It is useless to attempt what is
impossible.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp; BAT, trying to fly one day,
fell to the ground, and a
Weasel caught him. The Bat
begged the Weasel not to kill him.</p>

<p>“There is nothing I hate like a
bird,” said the Weasel; “I always
kill them.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/illus051.jpg" width="321" height="500" alt="weesel attacking bat" />
</div>

<p>“But I am not a bird,” said the
Bat, as he folded his wings close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a><br /><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
his sides; “birds don’t come tumbling
down as I did; and besides,
don’t you see my little smooth head,
and my ears?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said the Weasel, “I did
not notice them at first. I see, you
are a mouse”; so he let the Bat go.</p>

<p>Some time after, the Bat took
another flight, and again fell to the
ground. Another Weasel came out
of his hole and caught him.</p>

<p>“Pray don’t kill me,” said the Bat.</p>

<p>“Certainly I shall,” said the Weasel;
“I kill mice wherever I find them.”</p>

<p>“But stop a moment,” said the
Bat, spreading his wings; “I am not
a mouse. Don’t you see my great
wings? A mouse can’t fly, can it?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said the
Weasel; “I did not know that you
were a bird; I thought you were a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
mouse. I see I was mistaken.” Then
he let him go.</p>

<p>So the cunning Bat escaped a
second time, but it is not often safe
to use such arguments.</p>

<h2>THE FOX AND THE GOAT</h2>


<div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;FOX once happened to fall
into a deep well. He tried
in every way to get out, but
at last began to think that it was
impossible, and that he must die
there, a prisoner. While he was
thinking how sad that would be, a
thirsty Goat came and looked down
into the well, wishing that he could get
some water. He soon saw the Fox.</p>

<p>“Halloo,” said the Goat, “what are
you doing down there? Is the water
good?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“The best I ever tasted,” answered
the Fox. “It is cool, and clear,
and delicious. Come down and try it
yourself.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said the Goat, “for I am
nearly dead with thirst.”</p>

<p>So he jumped down, and drank as
much water as he wanted.</p>

<p>“Oh, how refreshing!” cried he.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Fox; “and now,
if you have finished drinking, let me
ask how you expect to get out of this
well again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” replied the
Goat. “How do you expect to get
out?”</p>

<p>“That is what I have been wondering
about for the last hour,” said the
Fox, “and have just now thought of
a good plan. If you will put your
forefeet high up on the wall, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
climb up your back, and so get out,
and then, of course, I can help you
out.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Goat, who
was a simple creature, “that is a good
plan. How I wish I had your brains!”
He put his forefeet on the wall, and
the Fox easily climbed out and started
to go on his way.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” called the Goat;
“you forgot to help me out.”</p>

<p>“You foolish fellow!” said the Fox,
with a mocking laugh; “you ought to
have thought how you would get out,
before you jumped down. I fell in,
but you went down of your own accord.
Look before you leap next time,”
and off he ran.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;WOMAN had a Hen that laid
an egg every day. The eggs
were large, and sold for a
good price. The Woman often thought,
as she took them to market: “How
glad they all are to get my eggs! I
could sell as many more just as
easily.”</p>

<p>It began to look a small thing to
her to get but a single egg each day.
“If I were to give a double allowance
of barley, the Hen might be made to
lay two eggs a day instead of one,”
she said.</p>

<p>So she doubled the food, and the
Hen grew very fat and sleek; but
she stopped laying eggs.</p>

manger full of hay, curling
himself up there for an afternoon nap.</p>

<p>When he had been sleeping comfortably
for some time, the Oxen came
in for their supper.</p>

<p>The Dog awoke in a great rage at
being disturbed, and began to growl
and bark at them. He would not let
them get at the hay.</p>

<p>“Stop a moment,” said one of the
Oxen. “Do you want to eat this
hay?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Dog; “I shouldn’t
think of such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said the Ox, “we
do want to eat it, for we are hungry
and tired.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, go away,” growled the Dog,
“and let me sleep.”</p>

said the Ox. “He will neither eat
the hay himself nor let us eat it!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MOUSE, who had always lived
on the land, and a Frog, who
passed most of his time in
the water, became friends.</p>

<p>The Mouse showed the Frog his
nest and everything he could think of
that was pleasant to see; and the
Frog invited the Mouse to go home
with him and see all the beautiful
things that are under the water.</p>

<p>“Can you swim?” asked the Frog.</p>

<p>“Not much,” said the Mouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“No matter,” said the Frog; “I
will tie your foot to my foot with a
piece of this strong grass, and then I
can pull you along nicely.” The Frog
laughed as he said this. He thought
it would be good fun for him, but he
well knew that the Mouse would not
enjoy it.</p>

<p>When the Frog had tied the Mouse’s
foot to his own, they started together
across the meadow. They soon came
to the edge of the water, and the
Frog jumped in, pulling the Mouse
in with him.</p>

<p>“Oh, how cool and nice the water
is, after the dry, hot land!” said the
Frog, as he swam gayly about. But
the poor Mouse was frightened.</p>

<p>“Please let me go,” said he, “or I
shall die.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind,” said the unkind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Frog; “you will get used to the
water. I just love it.”</p>

<p>But soon the poor Mouse was
drowned, and floated up to the top of
the water, while the Frog frisked about
down below.</p>

<p>Just then a Hawk saw the Mouse,
and pounced upon it.</p>

<p>As he flew away with it the Frog
was dragged out of the water, too, for
he was still tied to the Mouse.</p>

<p>“Stop, stop!” cried the Frog. “Let
me go. It is the Mouse you want.”</p>

<p>“Come along,” said the Hawk; “I
want you both. I will eat you first,
for I like Frog meat even better than
I do Mouse.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the Hawk had
made a good supper, and there was
nothing left of either the false Frog
or the foolish Mouse.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MAN who had a fine flock
of Sheep put them all into
a field, and hired a Boy to
take care of them, while he worked
near by with his Men.</p>

<p>The Sheep went nibbling the grass
all day, up and down the hills and
along the brook; and all that the Boy
had to do was to look out for the
Wolf, and see that he did not come
prowling into the field.</p>

<p>After a while the Boy began to
wish that something would happen,
it was so tiresome staying there all
alone, with no one to speak to and
nothing to do. He wished he could be
with the Men in the next field, or
that they could come and stay with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
him. All at once he thought to himself,
“I will make them think the Wolf
has come. That will be great fun.”</p>

<p>So he called out as loudly as he
could, “Help! help! The Wolf!”
and all the Men came running up.</p>

<p>When they found it was only a
joke, they laughed, and went back
to their work.</p>

<p>On the next day the Boy tried the
same trick again. As before, the Men
dropped their mattocks and spades,
for fear there might be danger, and
ran to the help of the Boy. He only
laughed at them for their pains, and
this time they did not relish the joke.
Still the Boy did not give it up.
Again he shouted “Wolf! Wolf!”
till the Men took no notice of him
when he called them, no matter how
loudly or how long he shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>After a while, the Wolf did get
into the field. Then in real terror the
Boy called and called: “Pray do come
and help me. The Wolf is killing the
sheep. The Wolf! the Wolf!” But no
one gave heed to his cries. Finding only
a terrified coward in care of the flock,
the Wolf left few of them uninjured.</p>

water, and with a sharp hook sticking
in his mouth; and he said to the
Fisherman:</p>

<p>“O sir, take pity upon me, and
throw me into the water again! See
what a little thing I am. I should
not make one mouthful for you now;
but if you leave me in the water, I
shall grow large and stout, and then
I shall be worth catching. You can
make a dinner of me then, or sell
me for a good price.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the Fisherman, “it is
true you are small, but I have you
safely now. If I should throw you
back, I might never catch you again.
You are better than nothing. I will
keep you”; and he put the little Fish

looking up saw her. “How good that
cheese smells!” thought he; “I’ll have
it, sure as I’m a Fox.”</p>

<p>Coming close to the tree, he said,
“My dear Madam, what a beautiful

till this moment what rare beauty
your family possesses. What eyes!
What glossy feathers! What grace

to be called the Queen of Birds. Will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
you not do me the favor to sing to
me?”</p>

<p>Now it is well known that the Caw!
Caw! of the Crow family is not musical.
She ought to have been on her
guard, but so delighted was she with
the flattery of the Fox that she forgot
to be wary. She opened her mouth
to show the Fox the sweetness of
her voice, when—down fell the bit
of cheese, which was exactly what
was expected.</p>

<p>The Fox ate it at one mouthful,
then stopped to say, “Thank you,
madam. I am quite satisfied. Your
voice is well enough, I have no
doubt. What a pity it is you are so
sadly wanting in wit!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Crow learned that we do well to
be on our guard when people flatter us.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;FOWLER caught a Partridge,

<p>“Wait a moment,” said the
Partridge; “don’t kill me.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” said the Fowler.</p>

<p>“Because I like to live,” said the
Partridge; “and, besides, if you let me
go, I will bring some of my friends
and neighbors here, and you can
catch them, and that will be better
than only one poor bird.”</p>

<p>“You are willing, then, that your
friends and neighbors should die,
to save your own life?” said the
Fowler. “Wicked Partridge! you
have lived long enough.” And he
killed it.</p>

<h2>THE HARES AND THE FROGS</h2>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="29" height="75" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN A FOREST, deep, shady, and
still, there once lived a company
of Hares.</p>

<p>Whenever a leaf fell rustling to the
ground, or a squirrel, jumping in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
branches, broke a twig, the Hares
started and trembled, they were so
timid.</p>

<p>One day there came a great wind,
rushing through the tops of the trees
with a roaring noise, and waving the
branches back and forth.</p>

<p>It frightened the Hares so much
that they all started together, running
as fast as they could to get out
of the forest, which had been their
home.</p>

<p>“What a sad state is ours,” they
said, “never to eat in comfort, to sleep
always in fear, to be startled by a
shadow, and fly with beating heart
at the rustling of the leaves. Better
death, by far. Let us drown ourselves
in yonder lake.”</p>

<p>But when they came to the lake,
it happened that there were scores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of frogs sporting on the banks; who,
when they heard the sound of footsteps,
jumped into the water.</p>

<p>The timid Hares were startled by
the splash; but, as they saw the frogs
dive to the bottom of the lake, a wise
old Hare said, “Stop a moment! let us
consider. Here are creatures that are
more timid than we—they are afraid
even of us. See, they are drowning
themselves for fear of us! It may
not be so bad with us as we thought.
Perhaps we have been foolish, as
foolish as the frogs, who are alarmed
when there is no danger. Let us make
the best of our lot, and try to be brave
in it.” So back they went again to
the forest.</p>

<h2>THE EAGLE AND THE ARROW</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MOST rapacious Eagle had
his eyrie on a lofty rock.
Sitting there, he could watch
the movements of the animals he
wished to make his prey, and, waiting
his opportunity, seize them and
bear them away.</p>

<p>The poor creatures had no protection
from such a foe. But an
archer saw him one day watching,
from his place of concealment, the
movements of an unsuspicious hare;
and, taking aim, he wounded him
mortally.</p>

<p>The Eagle gave one look at the
Arrow that had entered his heart,
and saw that its feathers had been
furnished by himself, when descending
to secure prey.</p>

<h2>THE EAGLE AND THE FOX</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-o.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day a mother Eagle came
flying out of her nest to
look for food for her babies.
She circled round and round, far up
in the air, looking down upon the
earth with her keen eyes.</p>

<p>By and by she saw a little baby
Fox, whose mother had left it alone
while, like the Eagle, she went for
food.</p>

<p>Down came the bird, whir went
her wings, and away she soared again,
with the little Fox clutched fast in
her claws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The poor mother Fox just at that
moment came running home to her
child, and saw it being carried away.</p>

<p>“O Eagle!” she cried, “leave me
my one little baby. Remember your
own children, and how you would feel
if one of them should be taken away.
Oh, bring back my poor cub!”</p>

<p>But the cruel Eagle, thinking that
the Fox could never reach her, in her
nest high in the pine tree, flew away
with the little Fox, and left the poor
mother to cry.</p>

<p>But the mother Fox did not stop
to cry long. She ran to a fire that
was burning in the field, caught up
a blazing stick of wood, and ran with
it in her mouth to the pine tree
where the Eagle had her nest.</p>

<p>The Eagle saw her coming, and
knew that the Fox would soon have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the tree on fire, and that all her
young ones would be burned. So, to
save her own brood, she begged the
Fox to stop, and brought her back
her little one, safe and sound.</p>

<p>The Vase spoke no words, but gave
out a fine, sweet perfume, which filled
the air and seemed to say: “I cannot
speak, and it is not well to be proud,
but I am full of good things that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
are hidden within me, and that gladly

People are drawn to me in their need,

<h2>THE TWO FROGS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-o.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONCE there were two Frogs
who were dear friends.</p>

<p>One lived in a deep pond
in the woods, where the trees hung
over the water, and where no one
came to disturb him.</p>

<p>The other lived in a small pool.
This was not a good place for a
Frog, or any one else, to live in, for
the country road passed through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
pool, and all the horses and wagons
had to go that way, so that it was
not quiet like the pond, and the
horses made the water muddy and
foul.</p>

<p>One day the Frog from the pond
said to the other, “Do come and live
with me; I have plenty of food and
water, and nothing to disturb me;
and it is so pleasant in my pond.
Now here there is very little food,
and not much water, and the road
passes through your pool, so that
you must always be afraid of
passers-by.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the other Frog;
“you are very kind, but I am quite
content here. There is water enough;
those who pass never trouble me;
and as to food, I had a good dinner
day before yesterday. I am used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
this place, you know, and do not like
change. But come and see me as
often as you can.”</p>

<p>The next time the Frog from the
pond came to visit his friend, he
could not find him.</p>

<p>“Too late!” sang a Bird, who
lived in a tree that overhung the
pool.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” said the
Frog.</p>

<p>“Dead and gone!” said the Bird.
“Run over by a wagon and killed,
two days ago, and a big Hawk came
and carried him off.”</p>

<p>“Alas! if he had only taken my
advice, he might have been well and
happy now,” said the Frog, as he
turned sadly towards home; “but he
would have his way, and I have lost
my friend.”</p>

<h2>THE LION AND THE MOUSE</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT ONCE happened that a hungry
Lion woke to find a Mouse just
under his paw. He caught the
tiny creature, and was about to make
a mouthful of him, when the little
fellow looked up, and began to beg
for his life.</p>

<p>In most piteous tones the Mouse
said: “Do not eat me. I meant
no harm coming so near you. If
you would only spare my life now,
O Lion, I would be sure to repay
you!”</p>

<p>The Lion laughed scornfully at
this, but it amused him so much
that he lifted his paw and let his
brave little prisoner go free.</p>

<p>It befell the great Lion, not long
afterward, to be in as evil a case as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
had been the helpless Mouse. And
it came about that his life was to be
saved by the keeping of the promise
he had ridiculed.</p>

<p>He was caught by some hunters,
who bound him with a strong rope,
while they went away to find means
for killing him.</p>

<p>Hearing his loud groans, the Mouse
came promptly to his rescue, and gnawed
the great rope till the royal captive
could set himself free.</p>

<p>“You laughed,” the little Mouse
said, “at the idea of my being able
to be of service to you. You little
thought I should repay you. But
you see it has come to pass that
you are as grateful to me as I was
once to you. The weak have their
place in the world as truly as the
strong.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;YOUNG Mouse, that had not
seen much of the world,
came home one day and
said: “O mother! I have had such
a fright! I saw a great creature
strutting about on two legs. I wonder
what it was! On his head was
a red cap. His eyes were fierce and
stared at me, and he had a sharp
mouth.</p>

<p>“All at once he stretched his long
neck, and opened his mouth so wide,
and roared so loud, that I thought
he was going to eat me up, and I
ran home as fast as I could. I was
sorry that I met him, for I had just
seen a lovely animal, greater even
than he, and would have made friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
with her. She had soft fur like ours,
only it was gray and white. Her
eyes were mild and sleepy, and she
looked at me very gently and waved
her long tail from side to side. I
thought she wished to speak to me,
and I would have gone near her, but
that dreadful thing began to roar,
and I ran away.”</p>

<p>“My dear child,” said the mother,
“you did well to run away. The
fierce thing you speak of would have
done you no harm. It was a harmless
Cock. But that soft, pretty thing
was the Cat, and she would have
eaten you up in a minute, for she is
the worst enemy you have in the
whole world. Appearances are not
always to be trusted.”</p>

Trees if they would give

<p>The Trees thought this was very

him a good piece of hard wood. But
as soon as the man had fitted the
handle to his Ax, he went to work
to chop down all the best Trees in
the forest.</p>

<p>As they fell groaning and crashing
to the ground, they said mournfully
one to another, “Our kindness was

his way he met the Fox.</p>

<p>“What makes you look so sour and
so forlorn, my friend?” said the Fox.</p>

<p>“Don’t speak to me!” growled the
Wolf. “I have lost my supper just
because I believed what a Nurse said
to a Baby.”</p>

<h2>THE CAT AND THE MARTINS</h2>


<div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;CAT, hearing that some Birds
who lived in a martin box
near by were ill, put on his
spectacles and his overcoat, and made
himself look as much as possible like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
a doctor, and went and knocked at
their door.</p>

<p>“I hear that you are all sick,” said
he, “and have come to call on you.
Let me in, and I will give you some
medicine and cure you.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said the Birds,
who saw his whiskers and knew he
was their enemy the Cat; “we are
well enough—much better than if
we should open our door and let
you in.”</p>

<h2>THE COCK AND THE FOX</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;FOX went prowling about a
farmyard, not seeing a trap
which the farmer had hidden
there to catch him. Snap! went the
trap, and the Fox found himself held
fast by a strong cord. He howled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
horribly and was almost beside himself
with rage.</p>

<p>A Cock, hearing the noise, flew to
the top of the fence. Looking over, he
saw the Fox and was terribly frightened—not
daring to go near him, even
when he found that his old enemy could
not move. But he could not refrain
from giving an exulting crow.</p>

<p>The Fox, looking up, said: “Dear
Mr. Cock, you see how unlucky I have
been, and all because I came here to
inquire after your health. Do please
help me to break this string, or at least
do not let any one know that I am
caught until I have time to gnaw it
with my teeth.”</p>

<p>The Cock said nothing, but went as
fast as he could and told his master all
about it. So the crafty Fox was served
as the Cock thought he deserved to be.</p>

<h2>THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;CAVALRY officer took the
greatest of pains with his
charger. As long as the war
lasted, the Horse was looked upon as
a companion and fellow helper. He
was carefully groomed every day, and
fed with hay and oats.</p>

<p>But when the war was over, the
allowance of grain and hay ceased,
and the Horse was fed with chaff
and whatever he might find by the
wayside. He was made a drudge too,
and was often forced to carry loads
much too heavy for his strength.</p>

<p>When, in course of time, war was
again proclaimed, the soldier brought
his military trappings and put them
on his charger; and, after having
arrayed his own person with his heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
coat of mail, he mounted to ride to
battle.</p>

<p>But the Horse, no longer equal to
the burden, fell down straightway under
the weight.</p>

<p>“You must go to the war on foot,” he
said to his master, “for you have transformed
me from a horse into an ass.”</p>

<p>He who slights his friends when he
does not need their best offices must
not expect them to serve him when
he needs them again.</p>

<h2>THE FOX AND THE STORK</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Fox and the Stork were on
what seemed to be friendly terms.
The Fox invited the Stork to a
dinner for which nothing was provided
but a soup, which was served on a wide,
shallow dish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fox presided at the feast with
great dignity, and, as if to set his friend
an example, proceeded to lap the soup.
This <i>he</i> could do with the greatest ease;
but the Stork, who could only dip the
tip of his bill in the dish and get the
tempting odor, fared badly. He praised
the dinner, but soon took leave, saying
to his friend that he should do himself
the honor to return the compliment.</p>

<p>This he did in a few days, but
ordered that nothing be brought to the
table but some minced meat in a glass
jar, the neck of which was so narrow
and deep that, though he himself could
eat very well, the Fox could not reach
it, and so could only lick the brim for
the bits that clung to it.</p>

<p>Reynard could not conceal his vexation,
but was obliged to own that he
had been rightly used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>They who practice cunning must
expect to suffer by it, and he laughs

<h2>THE DOG, THE COCK, AND THE

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;DOG and a Cock, who were
neighbors, once made a little
journey together.</p>

<p>When night came on, the Cock flew
up into the branches of a tree to sleep;
and the Dog found a hollow in the
trunk, into which he could creep and
lie down. They slept well, and as soon
as the morning dawned, the Cock, as
usual, began to crow.</p>

<p>A Fox, hearing the sound and thinking
he was sure of a good breakfast,
came and stood under the branches.
“Good morning,” said he to the Cock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“How glad I am to make the acquaintance
of the owner of such a voice!
Will you not come down here where
we can chat a little?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I cannot just yet,” replied
the Cock; “but if you would
like to come up here, go around the
tree trunk, and wake my servant. He
will open the door and let you in.”</p>

<p>The Fox did as he was requested;
but as he approached the tree, the Dog
sprang upon him, and tore him to
pieces.</p>

<p>“Two can play at the same game,”
said the Cock, as he looked down upon
the scene.</p>

<h2>THE FLY AND THE MOTH</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;FLY alighted one night upon a
pot of honey, and finding it
very much to his taste, began
to eat it along the edges.</p>

<p>Little by little, however, he had soon
crept away from the edge and into the
jar, until at last he found himself stuck
fast. His legs and wings had become
so smeared with the honey that he
could not use them.</p>

<p>Just then a Moth flew by, and seeing
him struggling there, said: “Oh, you
foolish Fly! Were you so greedy as
to be caught like that? Your appetite
was too much for you.”</p>

<p>The poor Fly had nothing to say in
reply. What the Moth said was true.
But by and by, when evening came, he
saw the Moth flying round a lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
candle in the giddiest way, and each
time a little closer to the flame, until
at last he flew straight into it and
was burned.</p>

<p>“What!” said the Fly, “are you
foolish, too? You found fault with me
for being too fond of honey; yet all
your wisdom did not keep you from
playing with fire.” It is sometimes
easier to see the foolishness of others
than to detect our own.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;LITTLE Boy once went in
bathing where the water was
too deep for him. When he
found himself sinking, he cried out to
a Man who was passing by, to come
and help him.</p>

<p>“Can’t you swim?” asked the Man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” replied the Boy, “I don’t
know how.”</p>

<p>“How foolish you were, then,” said
the Man, “to go into deep water!
Didn’t you know better?”</p>

<p>“Oh, good sir, please help me now,
or I shall drown!” cried the Boy.
“You can scold me when I am safe
on shore again.”</p>

<h2>THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;HARE one day made himself
merry over the slow pace of
the Tortoise, vainly boasting
of his own great speed in running.</p>

<p>The Tortoise took the laughing and
boasting in good part. “Let us try a
race,” she said; “I will run with you
five miles for five dollars, and the
Fox out yonder shall be the judge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hare agreed, a course was arranged,
and away they started together.
True to his boasting the Hare was out
of sight in a moment.</p>

<p>The Tortoise never for a moment
stopped, but jogged along with a
slow, steady pace, straight to the
end of the course. Full of sport, the
Hare first outran the Tortoise, then
fell behind. Having come midway to
the goal, he began to nibble at the
young herbage, and to amuse himself
in many ways. After a while, the day
being warm, he lay down for a nap,
saying: “She is behind me now. If
she should go by, I can easily enough
catch up.”</p>

<p>When the Hare awoke, the Tortoise
was not in sight; and running as fast
as he could, he found her comfortably
dozing at their goal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who are very quick are apt
to be too sure. Slow and steady often
wins the race.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AS AN Arab sat in his tent one
cold night, he saw the curtain
gently lifted, and the face of
his Camel looking in.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked kindly.</p>

<p>“It is cold, master,” said the Camel;
“suffer me, I pray thee, to hold my
head within the tent.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” replied the hospitable
Arab; and the Camel stood with
his head inside the tent.</p>

<p>“Might I also warm my neck a
little?” he entreated after a moment.</p>

<p>The Arab readily consented, and the
Camel’s neck was thrust within the tent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood, moving his head from
side to side uneasily, and presently
said: “It is awkward standing thus.
It would take but little more room
if I were to place my forelegs inside
the tent.”</p>

<p>“You may place your forelegs within
the tent,” said the Arab. And now he
had to move a little to make room, for
the tent was small.</p>

<p>The Camel spoke again: “I keep
the tent open by standing thus, and
make it cold for us both. May I not
stand wholly within?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Arab, whose compassion
included his beast as well as himself;
“come in wholly if you wish.”
But now the tent proved to be too
small to hold both.</p>

<p>“I think, after all,” said the Camel,
as he crowded himself in, “that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
will not be room here for us both.
You are the smaller; it will be best
for you to stand outside. There will
be room then for me.” So he pushed
a little, and the Arab with all haste
went outside the tent.</p>

<h2>THE FOX WHO HAD LOST HIS
TAIL</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;FOX was once caught in a trap
by his tail. He succeeded in
getting away, but was forced
to leave his “brush” behind. He soon
realized that his life would be a burden,
from the shame and ridicule to
which his tailless condition would expose
him.</p>

<p>“I must not own that it is a misfortune
not to have a bushy tail,” he
said to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>So he set about to induce all the
other Foxes to part with theirs. At
the next assembly he boldly made a
speech, in which he set forth the advantages
of his present state.</p>

<p>“The tail,” he said, “is no real part
of our persons, and besides being very
ugly to see, it exposes us to danger
from the dogs. I have never moved
about with such ease as since I gave
up my own.”</p>

<p>When he had ended his speech, a
sly old Fox arose, and giving his own
brush a graceful wave, said, with the
kind of sneer which all Foxes know so
well how to give, that if he had lost
by accident his own tail, he should,
without doubt, agree with his friend;
but that, as the brush was a fox’s chief
ornament and distinction, until such a
mishap should occur as had befallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
his friend, he should retain his own
and should advise the others to do
the same. And the vote to retain the
tails was given by a wave of the
brush. Yet many fashions have been
set by Foxes who have met with some
such accident.</p>

saw a number of Frogs sporting
in the water.</p>

<p>“Let us see if we can hit them; it
is great fun to make them dive,” said
one; and they all began to pelt them
with stones.</p>

<p>At last, after several Frogs had been
hit, one of them put his head up out
of the water, and said: “Pray stop,
Boys. Throwing stones at us may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
great sport for you, but it is death
to us. We have done you no harm,

<h2>THE SWALLOW AND THE OTHER
BIRDS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;WISE Swallow, seeing a man
sow seed in a field, went behind
him and picked up one
of the seeds to see what it was.</p>

<p>She found that it was flax. “When
this flax has grown,” she said to herself,
“the man will make it into linen
thread and use it to make nets for
catching us Birds.”</p>

<p>So she went to all the Birds and
told them what she had discovered,
begging them to come and help her
eat up the flaxseed before it should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
sprout. “This field,” she said, “is as
much ours as it is his. And while
one of us can do but little, all working
together can quickly remove our
danger.”</p>

<p>But the Birds would not listen to
her. Not one of them could she persuade
to help her pick up the seeds
which the farmer had sown.</p>

<p>By and by the flax sprang up, and
the Swallow tried again to persuade
the Birds to pull the young flax before
it grew large. But they all made
fun of her caution and let the flax
keep growing.</p>

<p>When she saw how heedless all the
Birds were, the Swallow would have
nothing more to do with them, but left
the woods where they lived and came
among men, building her nests in
barns and along the eaves of houses.</p>

ground, quite stiff and nearly
dead with cold.</p>

<p>In a fit of compassion the Farmer
brought him carefully to his house,
and laid him near the fire. But as
soon as the Snake began to feel the
pleasant warmth, he raised his head
and tried to bite his kind friend.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the Farmer, “is that the
way you repay me for my trouble?
You are a venomous creature, I am
sure, and the sooner you die the better.”
And he killed him with one blow
of his stick.</p>

<p>“No wonder the Swan is
so white,” thought the Raven, as he
looked at his own black feathers. “I
dare say <i>I</i> should be, if I were all the
time washing myself. I believe I’ll
try it.”</p>

<p>Then he left his home, where he
always found plenty to eat, and came
and lived by the lake. He washed
himself from morning till night, but
he grew no whiter; and, as he found
nothing to eat, he came near dying for
want of food.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a big battle between
the Birds and the Beasts.
Hesitating as to which to join,
the Bat kept away from the contest and
looked on till he thought the Beasts
would win the day.</p>

<p>Then he went among them. When
they saw him, they said, “But you are
a Bird.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said the Bat. “Look
at my body covered with hair and at
my mouth with its sharp teeth.”</p>

<p>After a while, as the fight went on,
the Birds began to have the best of it,
and then away flew the Bat to their
side. “What Beast comes here?” said
the Birds.</p>

<p>“I am not a Beast,” said the Bat;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
“I am a Bird. Look at my wings.
This is my battle as truly as it is
yours.”</p>

<p>But the Birds would have nothing
to do with him. And to this day the
Bat seems ashamed to show himself in
the daytime but hides in lonely places,
away from all other creatures, and only
flits about noiselessly in the dark, when
both Birds and Beasts are asleep.</p>

<h2>THE MAN, HIS SON, AND HIS
DONKEY</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MAN and his Son were once
driving their Donkey along a
country road, to sell him at
the fair. They soon passed some girls,
who were drawing water at a well.</p>

<p>“Look,” said one of the girls; “see
those silly people trudging along in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the dust, while their Donkey walks at
his ease.”</p>

<p>The Man heard what they said, and
put his boy on the Donkey’s back.
They had not gone far before they
came to some old men.</p>

<p>“See here, now,” said one of them
to the others, “this shows that what
I said is true. Nowadays the young
take no care of the old. See this boy
riding while his poor old father has
to walk by his side.”</p>

<p>Hearing this, the Man told his Son
to get down, and he mounted the
Donkey himself. In a little while they
met three women with children in their
arms.</p>

<p>“For shame!” said the women. “How
can you let that poor boy walk when
he looks so tired, and you ride like a
king?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The Man then took the boy up behind
him on the saddle, and they rode
on to the town. Just before they got
there, some young men stopped them
and said:</p>

<p>“Is that Donkey yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Man.</p>

<p>“One would not think so,” said they,
“by the way you load him. You look
more fit to carry him than he to carry
you.”</p>

<p>So the Man and the boy got off,
tied the Donkey’s legs with a rope,
fastened him to a pole, and, each taking
one end of the pole, carried him
along, while every one they met laughed
outright.</p>

<p>By and by they came to a bridge.
Then the Donkey began to kick, and
breaking the rope, fell into the water
and was drowned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The old Man and his Son made their
way home as best they could, thinking
to themselves, “When we try to please
everybody, we please nobody.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MOUSE from the city went
on a visit to a friend in the
country.</p>

<p>The Country Mouse, with many apologies,
brought out the best that he
had and waited on his guest.</p>

<p>There was plenty of oatmeal and
peas, a nice scrap of bacon, and even
a paring of cheese for dessert. While
the guest was dining, the Country
Mouse, out of politeness, would eat
none of these dainties, for fear there
should not be enough for both, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
nibbled a piece of straw to keep his
guest company.</p>

<p>When the dinner was over, the City
Mouse said: “Old friend, I thank you
for your courtesy, but I must have a
plain talk with you. I do not see how
you can bear to live so poor a life in
this little hole. Why not come with
me to the city, where you will have all
sorts of good things to eat and a gay
time? You are wasting your life.
When you have once seen the city you
will never be willing to return to this
quiet place.”</p>

<p>After being urged a long time, the
Country Mouse at last agreed to go to
the city that very night. So they
started off together, and about midnight
came to the great house where the City
Mouse lived. In the dining room was
spread a rich feast; and the City Mouse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a><br /><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
with many airs and graces, ran about
the table, and, picking out the nicest
bits, waited upon his country friend,
who, amazed at the good things, ate
to his heart’s content.</p>

<p>All at once the doors of the dining
room were flung open, and in came a
crowd of people, followed by a big dog,
who barked loudly and ran about the
room.</p>

<p>The Mice rushed for the hole, to escape,
and the little field Mouse almost
died of fright. As soon as he was able
to speak, he said:</p>

<p>“Well! if this is city life, I have seen
enough of it. Stay in this fine place if
you like. I shall be only too glad to
get home to my quiet, safer, country
house and my plain oatmeal and
peas.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“COME, my dears,” said a Cock
to his hens one morning; “I
am hungry, and so are you.
Let us go out. I will scratch up some
nice worms and beetles for our breakfast.”</p>

<p>The hens stood waiting while he
scratched.</p>

<p>But the first thing that he found was
neither a beetle nor a worm but a precious
stone. It may have been a ruby
or an emerald.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said the Cock; “what
is this? a Jewel! How glad anybody
else might be to have found such a
prize; but I have no need of it. I

<h2>THE OLD HOUND</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-o.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONCE there was a beautiful
Hound. He had long, silky
ears and a smooth, bright
skin; and he was not only beautiful
but strong and swift, and a faithful
servant. Whenever his master went
hunting, the Hound went with him
and chased the deer. After many years
the Hound grew old and feeble, but
still he followed his master, with the
other dogs.</p>

<p>One day a stag had been chased till
it was almost tired out, and the old
Hound came up with it and seized it;
but his teeth were old and broken and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
could not hold fast, so that the stag
gave a sudden bound and got away.
Just then the master rode up, and
seeing what had happened, was very
angry. He took his whip to strike his
faithful old Hound.</p>

<p>“Hold! hold! O dear Master,” said
he, “do not strike me. I meant to do
well. It is not my fault that I am old.
Remember what I have been, if you do
not like me as I am now.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">JUPITER having determined, it is
said, to appoint a sovereign over
the birds, proclamation was made
that on a certain day the candidates
should present themselves before him,
and he would choose the most beautiful
to be king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The Jackdaw, knowing his own ugliness,
yet wishing to rule over the birds,
searched through woods and fields for
feathers which had fallen from the
wings of his companions, and stuck
them all over his body.</p>

<p>When the appointed day arrived, and
the birds had assembled, the Jackdaw
made his appearance in his many-feathered
finery, and Jupiter proposed
to make him king.</p>

<p>Upon seeing this, the other birds
were indignant, and each plucking from
the Jackdaw his own kind of feathers,
they left the proposed king a plain
Jackdaw with no claim to superior
beauty.</p>

<h2>THE DONKEY AND THE LAP DOG</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="62" height="75" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a man who
had a Donkey and a little pet
Dog. The Donkey worked all
day in the fields and slept in the barn
at night.</p>

<p>But the Lap Dog frisked about and
played, jumping in his master’s lap
whenever he pleased, feeding from his
hand, and sleeping by his bed at night.</p>

<p>The Donkey grumbled a great deal
at this. “How hard I work!” said he,
“and I never get any pay but blows
and hard words. Why should I not be
petted like that wretched little Dog?
It may be partly my own fault. Perhaps
if I played with my master as he
does, I too might be treated like him.”</p>

<p>So the Donkey pushed his way into
the house, and jumped up on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>master’s knee, putting his forefeet on
his shoulders and giving a loud bray.</p>

<p>The master, almost deafened by the
noise and in danger from the great
clumsy creature, called out, “Help!
help!” and the servants, running in,
drove the Donkey out of doors with
sticks and stones.</p>

their approach, they came very close,
and taking aim, shot her.</p>

<p>Finding herself wounded, she said,
“O unhappy creature that I am, to take
such care as I did against the dangers
of the land, and then, after all, to find
this seashore, to which I had come for
safety, so much more perilous!”</p>

<p>But after a time, perceiving the
meekness and gentleness of the animal’s

approach him. The Camel so readily
obeyed the commands that were given
him, and seemed so wanting in spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;WOLF met a Dog, and seeing
that he looked fat and
sleek, said to him, “How
does it happen, my friend, that you
are so plump, while I, although I run
after game day and night, am half
starved?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said the Dog, “I do not
have to run after my food. I only
guard the house at night, and all the
family pet me and feed me with scraps
from their own plates. Come and live
with me, and you shall be as well off
as I am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“That I should like,” said the Wolf.
“I will at least go with you and try
the life.”</p>

<p>As they trotted along the road together,
the Wolf saw a mark on the
Dog’s neck, and asked him what
it was.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is nothing,” said the Dog;
“only a little mark made by the fretting
of my chain.”</p>

<p>“Do you wear a chain?” asked the
Wolf; “and do you mean to say that
you are tied up?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said the Dog; “they tie
me in the daytime, but at night I can
go where I please. It is a bit annoying
at first, but one soon gets used
to it.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said the Wolf; “that is
enough for me. Though I may not be
fat, I will at least be free.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON THE bank of a river grew
a tall Oak Tree. It stood with
its roots firm in the ground,
and its head high in the air, and said
to itself: “How strong I am! Nothing
shall make me bow. I look down upon
all the other trees.”</p>

<p>But one day there was a storm.
The terrible unseen wind came and
struck the proud Oak. Crash! went
the trunk, down came all the beautiful
branches, and the Tree fell into the
river. As the water carried it away,
it passed a Reed that grew on the
bank. The little Reed stood up tall
and slender, and looked at the poor
broken Tree.</p>

<p>“O Reed,” said the Tree, “how did
it happen that you were not broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
down and spoiled when the wind came?
You are so little and weak, and I was
so strong and proud.”</p>

<p>“Ah, poor Tree!” said the Reed,
“that is just the reason that the wind
did not hurt me. I bent low until it
had gone by, but you stood stiff and
tried to stop it on its way. No one
can stop the wind. It must go where
it is sent, but it will not hurt those
who are not proud and stubborn.”</p>

<p>“Pray tell me, are you an enemy or

asked the Hawk to help them.</p>

<p>“You are the only bird of our acquaintance,”
they said, “that can protect
us from our enemy. If you will
take care of us, we shall feel safe.”</p>

<p>The Hawk at once consented, and
took up his abode in the dovecote.
But when the Pigeons had let him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
come in, they found that he slew more
of them in a single day than the Kite
could possibly pounce upon in a whole
year.</p>

<p>The oldest, wisest pigeon among
them said: “When we are in trouble,
we must not forget that there are other
dangers than the ones we are suffering
from. There is a proverb among men
that tells them to avoid a remedy that
is worse than the disease.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;WAR Horse, ready for battle,
with his splendid saddle and
jingling bridle, came galloping
swiftly along the highroad, his
hoofs sounding like thunder on the
hard ground.</p>

<p>A poor old Mule, with a heavy load<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
on his back, was going slowly down
the same road.</p>

<p>“Out of my way,” said the War
Horse, “or I will trample you in the
dust!”</p>

<p>The poor Mule made room for him
as fast as he could, and the Horse
went proudly on his way.</p>

<p>Not long after this the Horse was
shot in the eye; and, as he was no
longer fit for the army, his fine saddle
and bridle were taken off, and he was
sold to a farmer, who made him drag
heavy loads.</p>

<p>Since he had not been trained to
the work, it came hard to him, and he
complained bitterly.</p>

<p>The Mule, meeting him soon after,
knew him and called out: “Aha! is it
you? I thought pride would have a
fall some day.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE North Wind and the Sun
once fell into a dispute as to
which was the stronger of the
two. They related their most famous
exploits, and each ended as he began,
by thinking he had the greater power.</p>

<p>Just then a traveler came in sight, and
they agreed to test the matter by trying
to see which of them could soonest
make the traveler remove his cloak.</p>

<p>The boastful North Wind was the
first to try, the Sun meanwhile watching
behind a gray cloud. He blew a
furious blast and nearly tore the cloak
from its fastenings; but the Man only
held his cloak more closely, and old
Boreas spent his strength in vain.</p>

<p>Mortified by his failure to do so
simple a thing, the Wind withdrew at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
last in despair. “I don’t believe you
can do it, either,” he said.</p>

<p>Then out came the kindly Sun in all
his splendor, dispelling the clouds that
had gathered and sending his warmest
rays down upon the traveler’s head.</p>

<p>The Man looked up gratefully, but,
growing faint with sudden heat, he
quickly flung aside his cloak, and hastened
for comfort to the nearest shade.</p>

<p>Persuasion is often better than force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing that he must be attacked, the
other one fell flat upon the ground;
and when the Bear came up, felt him
with his snout, and smelt him all
over, the man held his breath, feigning
death.</p>

<p>The Bear soon left him, for it is
said a Bear will not touch a dead
body.</p>

<p>When the Bear had gone, the man
in the tree came down to join his
companion, and, as a pleasant joke,
inquired, “What was it that the Bear
whispered in your ear when he bent
over you for so long?”</p>

<p>His friend replied very gravely: “He
gave me this bit of advice, ‘Never
travel with a friend who deserts you
at the approach of danger.’”</p>

Why is it that the mere mention

Traveler called upon the driver to stop
for rest. To escape from the direct heat
of the sun, which was shining in all
its strength, the Traveler proceeded to
sit down in the shadow of the Mule.</p>

<p>But a violent dispute arose, for the
shadow was sufficient for but one, and
the driver, a lusty fellow, rudely pushed
the Traveler one side, claiming the spot
for himself, saying: “When you hired
this Mule of me, you said nothing about
the shadow. If now you want that too,
you must pay for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The discussion grew so violent that
they forgot the Mule, who took advantage
of his freedom and ran away.

they lost the substance.</p>

<p>Some shepherds who chanced to

<h2>THE PORCUPINE AND THE

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;PRICKLY Porcupine came
wandering along one day,
looking for a place to live.</p>

<p>He found a family of Snakes in a
warm cave, and asked them to let him
share their shelter.</p>

<p>The Snakes consented, though much
against their will, and the Porcupine
crept into their home. But it was not
long before they found that his sharp
quills stuck into them and hurt them,
and they wished they had never let
him in.</p>

<p>“Dear Porcupine, please go away,”
they said; “you are so large and so
prickly.”</p>

<p>But the Porcupine was very rude,
and said: “Oh, no. If you do not like
it here, you can go away. I find it
very comfortable.”</p>

<p>It was too late that the Snakes
learned that it is easier to keep an
intruder out than to compel him to
go when you have once let him in.</p>

<h2>THE BUNDLE OF STICKS</h2>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AN Old Man had many Sons,
who were often quarreling.
He tried to make them good
friends, but could not. As the end of
his life drew near, the old Man called
them all to him and showed them a
bundle of sticks tied tightly together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now,” said the Father, “see if you
can break this bundle of sticks.”</p>

<p>Each of the Sons in turn took the
bundle and tried with all his might to
break it, but could not. When all had
tried and given it up, the Father said,
“Untie the bundle, and each of you
take a stick and see if you can break
that.” This they could do very easily.
Then said the Father:</p>

<p>“You saw when the sticks were
bound together how strong they were;
but as soon as they were untied, you
broke them easily. Now, if you will
stop quarreling and stand by each
other, you will be like the bundle of
sticks—no one can do you any harm;
but if you do not keep together, you
will be as weak as is one of the little
sticks by itself, which any one can
break.”</p>

<h2>THE MISCHIEVOUS DOG</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="62" height="75" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a Dog who
used to run at every one whom
he met, but so quietly that no
one suspected harm from him till he
began to bite his heels.</p>

<p>In order to give notice to strangers
that the Dog could not be trusted, and
at the same time to punish the Dog
himself, the master would sometimes
hang a bell about his neck and compel
him to drag a heavy clog, which
he firmly attached to his collar by a
chain.</p>

<p>For a time the Dog hung his head;
but seeing that his bell and clog
brought him into notice, he grew proud
of them, and ran about the market place
to display them and attract attention to
himself. He even went so far as to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
himself airs with the other dogs, who
had no such mark of distinction.</p>

<p>An old Hound, seeing it, said: “Why
do you make such an exhibition of
yourself, as if your bell and clog were
marks of merit? They do indeed bring
you into notice; but when their meaning
is understood, they are marks of
disgrace—a reminder that you are an
ill-mannered cur. It is one thing to
be renowned when our virtues give
occasion for it; it is quite another to
become notorious for our faults.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Fox and the Leopard once
disputed who was the more beautiful.
The Leopard exhibited, one

his skin. The Fox, who was even more
proud of his wits than of his person,
interrupted him at last by saying: “Yet
when all is said, how much more beautiful
am I, who am decorated not simply
in body but in mind. The person
should be of more value than his coat.”</p>

and made a petition to
the Trees to provide him a
handle for his ax.</p>

<p>The Trees, honored by his civility,
acceded to his request, and held a
consultation to decide which of them
should be given him.</p>

<p>Without a dissenting voice, they
chose the Ash, who, it seems, is not
a favorite among the Trees. Some of
them were bold enough to say that
bad luck went with the Ash, and that
at heart they were not bound to be in
sympathy with woodcutters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>The Woodman cut down the Tree,
and fitted the handle to his ax; then
to the dismay of the Trees, set to work
and, with strong strokes, quickly felled
all the noblest giants of the forest.</p>

<p>Lamenting too late the fate of his
companions, an old Oak remarked to a
neighboring Cedar:</p>

<p>“The first step has lost us all. If
we had not so willingly given up the
rights of the Ash, we might have stood

tripped gayly along on her way to the
town, whither she was going to sell
her milk.</p>

<p>“For this milk,” said Dolly, “I shall
get a shilling, and with it I will buy
twenty of the eggs laid by our neighbor’s
fine fowls. The mistress will
surely lend me a hen, and, allowing
for all mishaps, I shall raise a good
dozen of chicks. They will be well
grown before the next fair-time comes
around, and it is then that chickens
bring the highest price. I shall be able
to sell mine for a guinea.</p>

<p>“Then I shall buy that jacket that
I saw in the village the other day, and
a hat and ribbons too. And when I go
to the fair, how smart I shall be!</p>

<p>“Robin will be there, and will come
up and offer to be friends again. But

<p>Here Dolly gave her head the least

talking together in the middle of
the forest.</p>

<p>“I do not care what happens,” said

added, “what would you do if there
should be an invasion?”</p>

<p>“I have but one course,” Puss replied.
“If that would not serve me, I
should be undone.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for you,” said the Fox.
“I would gladly teach you one or two
of my tricks, but it is not wise to
trust another. We must each take
care for himself.”</p>

<p>These words were hardly spoken,
when a pack of hounds came upon
them in full cry.</p>

<p>The Cat, by means of her one well-proved
safeguard, ran up a tree and sat
serenely among the branches. “This
is my way,” she said to the Fox.
“What is yours to be?”</p>

<p>The Fox, with all his thousand
tricks, was not able to get out of sight,
and fell a prey to the dogs.</p>

hard to tell which was the

<p>One day, as they were roaming together,
they spied some chestnuts roasting
in the ashes of a fire.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the cunning Monkey,
“we shall not go dinnerless to-day.
Your claws are better than mine for
the purpose; pull the chestnuts out of
the ashes and you shall have half.”</p>

<p>Puss pulled them out, burning her
paws very much in doing so. When
she had stolen every one, she turned
to the Monkey for her share of the
booty; but, to her chagrin, she could
find no chestnuts, for he had eaten
them all.</p>

<p>The Shepherd stood on his guard
against him for a while, and kept
strict watch that he did not come too
near. But as day after day passed and
the Wolf showed no disposition to injure
any of the flock, he allowed him
to approach nearer, till at last he came
among the Sheep, and seemed to watch
over them like a dog.</p>

<p>“He is really quite a help to me,”
said the Shepherd to himself; “and
I have never seen him make the
slightest effort to seize a sheep or a
lamb.”</p>

<p>So, having occasion to go to town
one day, he left his flock in the care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of the Wolf, whom he regarded as a
guardian over them.</p>

<p>But no sooner was the man gone,
than the Wolf, seeing his opportunity,
fell upon the Sheep and destroyed the
greater part of them.</p>

<p>“I have been rightly served,” said
the Shepherd, on his return. “Why did
I not know better than to trust my
Sheep to their worst enemy? Soon or
late, nature will show itself.”</p>

“that, with such dainty food upon my

despised thistle; but to me the bitter,
prickly weed has a more savory relish
than anything else in the world. Let
others choose what they will, but give
me a fine, juicy thistle like this, and I
shall be content. Every one to his
taste. It is wisely ordered that what
one rejects should be the choice of
another. A wise man has said that a
weed is a plant that people have not
yet found a use for.”</p>

<h2>THE SICK STAG</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;STAG, whose joints had become
stiff with age, was at
great pains to gather an abundant
supply of food—enough, as he
thought, for the remainder of his days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>He stretched himself beside it, in
a quiet, sunny corner of his pasture,
and now dozing, now nibbling, was
passing a happy old age.</p>

<p>He had been a favorite among his
companions, and they now came often,
and in great numbers, to call upon him
and wish him good luck. He made
them welcome in a hospitable manner,
and each, as often as he came, helped
himself to a little of the food so abundantly
provided.</p>

<p>The end of the matter was, that the
poor Stag died, not so much from either
sickness or old age as from want of
the food which his friends had eaten
for him. Before doing a thing, it is
well sometimes to consider, “What if
every one should do it?”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;WOODMAN, felling a tree by the
side of a river, let his ax drop
by accident into the stream.</p>

<p>Being thus suddenly deprived of the
tool by means of which he gained his
livelihood, he sat down upon the bank
and lamented his hard fate.</p>

<p>To his surprise Mercury appeared
and asked him what was the matter.
Having heard the story of the man’s
misfortune, he dived to the bottom of
the river, and bringing up a golden
ax, inquired if that was the one he
had lost.</p>

<p>On his saying that it was not his,
Mercury dived a second time, and returning
with a silver ax in his hand,
again demanded of the Woodman if it
was his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>This also the Woodman refused, saying
that it was none of his. Mercury
disappeared a third time and brought
up the ax that the man had lost. This
the poor man took with joy and
thankfulness.</p>

<p>So pleased was Mercury with the
honesty of the man, that he gave him
the other two axes in addition to his
own.</p>

<p>The Woodman, on his return home,
related to his companions all that had
happened. One of them resolved to
see if he could secure the same good
fortune to himself.</p>

<p>He ran to the river and threw his
ax in, then sat down upon the bank to
lament his sad fate.</p>

<p>Mercury appeared as before and demanded
to know the cause of his grief.
After hearing the man’s account, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
dived and brought up a golden ax and
asked the man if that was his.</p>

<p>Transported at the sight of the precious
metal, the fellow eagerly answered
that it was, and greedily attempted to
snatch it. The god, detecting his falsehood
and greed, not only declined to
give him the golden ax but refused
to recover for him his own.</p>

met a huge Elephant,
bearing his royal master and
the master’s favorite dog, cat, parrot,

<p>An admiring crowd followed the
great beast and his attendants, so that
the entire road was filled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“How foolish you are,” said the Rat
to the people, “to make such a fuss
at seeing an elephant. Is it his great
bulk that you so much admire? Mere
size is nothing. At most it can only
frighten little girls and boys, and I can
do that as well. I am a beast as well
as he. I have as many legs, and ears,
and eyes. If you will take the trouble
to compare us, you will see that I have
finer parts. What right, then, has he to
take up all the highway, which belongs
to me as well as to him?”</p>

<p>At this moment, the Cat from her
high place spied the Rat. She jumped
to the ground and soon convinced him
that he was not an Elephant.</p>

<p>In this net he captured several cranes

occasion, was a Stork. The cranes and
geese accepted their lot as one of the
chances to which such lives as theirs
were subject; but the Stork was in
very sad case and pleaded hard for
his life.</p>

<p>Among other reasons why he should
not be put to death, the Stork urged
that he was neither goose nor crane
but a poor, harmless Stork, who performed
his duty to his parents as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
as ever he could, feeding them when
they were old, and carrying them, when
required, from place to place upon his

<p>“All this may be true,” replied the
Husbandman; “but, as I have taken
you in bad company, and in the same
crime, you must expect to suffer the

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;SATYR, ranging in the forest

Traveler who was half starved

<p>He took pity upon him and invited
him to come to his cave for food and

<p>On their way, the Man kept blowing
upon his fingers. “Why do you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
that?” said the Satyr, who had seen
but little of the world of men.</p>

<p>“To warm my hands,” replied the
Man; “they are nearly frozen.”</p>

<p>Arriving at the cave, the Satyr poured
out a smoking mess of pottage and set
it before the Traveler, who eagerly
seized it and began to blow upon it
with all his might.</p>

<p>“What, blowing again!” exclaimed
the Satyr. “Is it not hot enough?”</p>

<p>“It is, indeed,” answered the Man;
“that is the very reason why I am
blowing it. I want to cool it enough
to be able to eat it.”</p>

<p>Upon this the Satyr exclaimed in
alarm, “Be off with you! I will have
no part with a Man who can blow hot
and cold from the same mouth.”</p>

<p>“How beautiful are my fine spreading
horns!” said he. “How strong and
graceful they are, branching from each
side of my head! What a pity it is that
my legs should be so thin and ugly!”</p>

<p>Just at this moment a lion came
crashing through the forest and made
ready to spring upon him. Away went
the stag! and the legs that he had
despised would soon have carried him
out of danger; but when he came to
the thick woods, his beautiful antlers,
of which he had been so vain, caught
in the branches and held him fast until
the lion came up and seized him.</p>

an Apple Tree which for year
after year had borne no fruit,
but served only as a harbor for sparrows
and grasshoppers.</p>

<p>Seeing no good to himself in the
tree, he resolved to cut it down, and,
taking his ax in his hand, he made a
bold stroke at its roots.</p>

<p>Each in his own way, the grasshoppers
and sparrows entreated him not to
cut down the tree that sheltered them.
“We will do our best to make up to
you the worth of the wood, if you will
spare it,” they said, “lightening your
labor by our cheering songs.” But he
paid no heed to them and gave a second
and a third blow with his ax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>When he reached the hollow of the
tree, he found a hive full of honey.
He tasted the honeycomb and at once
threw down his ax. From that time
the greatest of care was taken of the
tree, and the sparrows and grasshoppers
still found shelter in it. They
could not forget, however, that the man
had only saved their home for them
from self-interest.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ACCORDING to an old legend,
the first man was made by
Jupiter, the first bull by Neptune,
and the first house by Minerva.</p>

<p>On the completion of their labors, a
dispute arose as to which had made the
most perfect work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>They agreed to rest the decision with
Momus, a judge, and to abide by his
word.</p>

<p>Momus, however, being very envious
of the handicraft of each, found fault in
turn with all.</p>

<p>He criticized the work of Neptune
because he had not made the horns of
the bull below the eyes, that the animal
might better see where to strike.</p>

<p>He condemned the work of Jupiter
because he had not placed the heart of
man on the outside, so that every one
might read the thoughts of the evil-disposed
and take precautions against
intended mischief.</p>

<p>And last of all, he inveighed against
Minerva, not because of any fault in
the house itself but because she had
not contrived iron wheels in its foundation,
so that its inhabitants might more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
easily remove if a neighbor proved
unpleasant.</p>

<p>Indignant at such inveterate fault-finding,

office as judge and expelled him from
the mansions of Olympus.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN DAYS of old, a mighty rumbling
was heard in a Mountain.
It was said to be in Labor, and
multitudes of people flocked together,
from near and from far, to see what the
great Mountain would produce. After
long expectation and wise conjecturing
from the bystanders, out popped—a
mouse.</p>

<p>A magnificent promise, but a paltry
performance.</p>

<h2>JUPITER AND THE CAMEL</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Camel, in days of yore, besought
Jupiter to grant him
horns, because it was a great
grief to him to see other animals furnished
with what he had not. Jupiter not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
only refused him horns but cropped his
ears short for his foolish importunity.</p>

<p>By asking for what we do not need,
we may lose what we already have.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Moon once asked her
Mother to make her a little coat
that would fit her well. “How,”
replied the Mother, “can I make a cloak
to fit you, when now you are a New
Moon, and then a Full Moon, and then
again neither the one nor the other?”</p>

<h2>THE HORSE AND THE STAG</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;HORSE once had the whole
range of a meadow to himself;
but when a Stag came and
threatened to damage the pasture, the
Horse asked a Man to assist him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
ridding him of the Stag. “I will,” said
the Man, “if you will let me put a bit in
your mouth and get upon your back so
as to go and find weapons.” The Horse
consented, and the Man accordingly
mounted. But instead of being revenged
on the Stag, the Horse has been from
that time the slave of Man.</p>

<p>Revenge is dearly punished at the
price of liberty.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;GREAT Cloud passed rapidly
over a country which was
parched by heat, but did not
let fall a single drop to refresh it.
Presently it poured copious streams
of rain into the sea and, when it had
done so, began to boast of its generosity
in the hearing of the neighboring
Mountain.</p>

<p>But the Mountain replied: “What
good have you done by such generosity?
and how can any one help
being pained at the sight of it? If
you had poured your showers over
the land, you might have saved a
whole district from famine. But as
to the sea, my friend, it has plenty
of water already, without additions
from you.”</p>

<h2>THE ELEPHANT IN FAVOR</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-o.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONCE upon a time the Elephant
stood high in the good
graces of the Lion. The forest
immediately began to talk of the
matter, and, as usual, many guesses
were made as to the means by which
the Elephant had gained such favor.</p>

<p>“It is no beauty,” say the beasts to
each other, “and it is not amusing; and
what habits it has! what manners!”</p>

<p>“If it had possessed such a bushy
tail as mine, I should not have wondered,”
says the Fox.</p>

<p>“Or, sister,” says the Bear, “if it
had gotten into favor on account of
its claws, no one would have found
the matter at all extraordinary; but
it has no claws at all, as we all
know well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Isn’t it its tusks that have gotten it
into favor?” thus the Ox broke in upon
their conversation. “Haven’t they, perhaps,
been mistaken for horns?”</p>

<p>Then said the Ass, shaking its ears,
“Is it possible that you don’t know
how it has succeeded in making itself
liked, and in becoming distinguished.
Why, I have guessed the reason. If it
hadn’t been remarkable for its long
ears, it would never in the world have
gotten into favor.”</p>

<h2>THE CUCKOO AND THE EAGLE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Eagle promoted the Cuckoo
to the rank of a Nightingale,
and at once, proud of its new
position, the Cuckoo seated itself upon
an aspen and began to exercise its
musical talents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>After a time it looked around. All
the other birds were flying away, some
laughing and others abusing it. The
Cuckoo grew angry, and hastened to
the Eagle with a complaint against
the birds.</p>

<p>“Have pity on me!” it begged. “I
have been appointed Nightingale to
these woods, and yet the birds dare
laugh at my singing.”</p>

<p>“My friend,” answered the Eagle, “I
am a king, but I am not a god. It
is impossible for me to remedy the
cause of your complaint. I can order
a Cuckoo to be styled a Nightingale,
but to make a Nightingale out of a
Cuckoo—that I cannot do.”</p>

<h2>THE FOX IN THE ICE</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-v.jpg" width="83" height="75" alt="V" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">VERY early one winter morning,
during a hard frost, a Fox
was drinking at a hole in the
ice not far from the haunts of men.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, whether by accident or
from negligence does not matter, the
end of its tail got wet and froze to
the ice.</p>

<p>No great harm was done; the Fox
could easily remedy it. It had only to
give a tolerably hard pull and leave
about a score of hairs behind; then it
could run home quickly before any one
came.</p>

<p>But how could it make up its mind
to spoil its tail? Such a bushy tail
as it was—so ample, so golden! No;
better wait a little. Surely men are
sleeping still. It is even possible that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a thaw may set in meanwhile. In that
case it will be able to withdraw its tail
easily from the ice hole.</p>

<p>So it waits; it goes on waiting, but
its tail only freezes all the more. The
Fox looks round; the day is already
beginning to dawn. People are stirring;
voices are to be heard. Our poor
Fox begins to move wildly about, now
this way and now that. But still it
cannot free itself from the hole.</p>

<p>Luckily, a Wolf comes running that
way.</p>

<p>“Dear friend! father!” cries the Fox;
“do save me; I am all but lost!”</p>

<p>So the Wolf stopped and set to work
to rescue the Fox. Its method was a
simple one—it bit the tail clean off.</p>

<p>So our foolish friend went home tailless,
but rejoicing that its skin was still
on its back.</p>

<h2>THE INQUISITIVE MAN</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">“GOOD day, dear friend; where
do you come from?”</p>

<p>“From the Museum, where
I have spent three hours. I saw everything
they have there, and examined
it carefully. So much have I seen to
astonish me that, if you will believe
me, I am neither strong nor clever
enough to give you the description
of it. Upon my word, it is a palace
of wonders.</p>

<p>“How rich is Nature in inventions!
What birds and beasts have I not seen
there! What flies, butterflies, cockroaches,
and curious beetles—some
like emeralds, others like corals! And
what tiny cochineal insects! Why,
really, some of them are smaller than
a pin’s head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“But did you see the elephant?
What did you think of it? I’ll be
bound you felt as if you were at a
mountain.”</p>

<p>“The elephant? Are you quite sure
it is there?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, brother, you mustn’t be too
hard on me; but to tell the truth, I
didn’t remark the elephant.”</p>

<h2>THE SQUIRREL IN SERVICE</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;SQUIRREL once served a
Lion—I know not where or
in what capacity. But this
much is certain—the Squirrel found
favor in the Lion’s eyes, and to satisfy
the Lion is certainly no light affair.</p>

<p>In return for this he was promised
a whole wagonload of nuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Promised—yes; but meanwhile time
continues to fly by. The Squirrel often
suffers hunger and, while grinning in
his masters presence, has eyes full
of tears.</p>

<p>When he looks around in the forest,
his former comrades show themselves
here and there, high up among the
trees. He looks at them till his eyes
begin to blink, but they keep on
cracking nuts.</p>

<p>The Squirrel takes a look at them—he
can do no more. At one time he is
called away; at another, even dragged
off in the Lion’s service.</p>

<p>But see! At last the Squirrel has
grown old and become tiresome to the
Lion. It is time for him to retire. They
have granted the Squirrel his discharge,
and they have actually given him the
full load of nuts—excellent nuts, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
as the world has never seen before; all
picked fruit, one as good as another,
a perfect marvel. Only one thing is
unlucky—the Squirrel has long ago
lost all his teeth.</p>

<h2>THE WOLF AND THE CAT</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;WOLF ran out of the forest
into a village—not to pay a
visit, but to save its life; for
it trembled for its skin.</p>

<p>The huntsman and a pack of hounds
were after it.</p>

<p>It would fain have rushed in through
the first gateway, but there was this
unfortunate circumstance in the way—all
the gateways were closed.</p>

<p>The Wolf saw a Cat on a partition
fence and said pleadingly: “Vaska, my
friend, tell me quickly, which of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
moujiks here is the kindest, so that I
may hide myself from my evil foes.
Listen to the cry of the dogs and the
terrible sound of the horns. All that
noise is actually made in chase of me.”</p>

<p>“Go quickly and ask Stefan,” said
Vaska, the Cat; “he is a very kind
man.”</p>

<p>“Quite true; only I have torn the
skin off one of his sheep.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, try Demian.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’s angry with me, too;
I carried off one of his kids.”</p>

<p>“Run over there, then; Trofim lives
there.”</p>

<p>“Trofim! I should be afraid of even
meeting him. Ever since the spring
he has been threatening me about a
lamb.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, that’s bad! But perhaps
Klim will protect you.”</p>

<p>“What do I hear, friend? You’ve
quarreled with all the village,” said
Vaska to the Wolf. “What sort of protection
can you hope for here? No, no;
our peasants are not so destitute of
sense as to be willing to save you to
their own hurt. And, really, you have
only yourself to blame. What you
have sown, that you must now reap.”</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-n.jpg" width="91" height="75" alt="N" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NOTE. Since the purpose of the fable is not
merely to entertain but especially to point
some general truth or to draw a helpful
lesson, no two versions of the same fable are exactly
alike. In editions of Æsop intended for young children,
it has been the custom to elaborate the slender
story in such a way as to arouse thoroughly the child’s
interest before the moral is drawn. Hence the modern
popular versions often contain conversations and descriptive
details not to be found in the accounts which
are truest to the Greek versions. This popular elaborated
form of the fable, however, needs no apology so
long as the editor is true to the spirit of the original.
In the preceding fables, the spirit, if not the letter of
the most trustworthy account available, has been carefully
adhered to, but the editor has had always in mind
the youthful readers and has neglected no opportunity
to make the text fit their limited experience and
understanding. But to both teacher and pupil the current
short forms of some of the longer fables will have
interest. In this Appendix, therefore, have been collected
the short forms of the first fables which appear
in the text. Much pleasure and profit can be had
from a comparison of the two renderings, and such a
comparison will open the way to a discussion of the
difficulties in handing down literature orally and in
preserving it in correct form.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;WOLF and a Lamb came to a running
brook to quench their thirst.
The Wolf stood high up the stream
and the Lamb a little distance below. Having
made up his mind to seize the Lamb, the
Wolf bethought himself how he might justify
his act of violence. Running down to her, he
roared, “How dare you muddle the water so
that I cannot drink it?”</p>

<p>The Lamb, affrighted by the charge, humbly
replied that she could not see how that
could be, since the water ran down from him
to her and not from her to him. “Be that
as it may,” retorted the Wolf. “You are a
rascal, all the same, and I have heard that
you said bad things of me last year behind
my back.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said the Lamb, “that could not have
been, for a year ago I was not born.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it was not you it was your father,
and that is all the same,” replied the Wolf,
and he fell upon the Lamb and tore her to
pieces.</p>

where ripe grapes were hanging in
tempting clusters over the branch of

ran up and down in the greatest
agony, begging every animal he met
to relieve him, hinting at the same time that
there would be a substantial reward. A Crane,
moved by his entreaties, ventured her long
neck down the Wolf’s throat and drew forth
the bone. When she had done it, she modestly
asked for the promised reward. To which the
Wolf, grinning and showing his teeth, replied,
“Ungrateful creature, is it not enough that
you have had your head in a Wolf’s mouth
and brought it out safe?”</p>

habitation.</p>

<p>A Grasshopper, who had chanced to out-live
the summer and was ready to die from
cold and hunger, approached with great humility
and begged that they would relieve his
necessity with one grain of wheat or rye.
One of the Ants asked him how he had disposed
of his time in the summer, that he had
not taken pains and laid in a stock as they
had done.</p>

<p>“Alas! gentlemen,” said he, “I passed away
the time merrily and pleasantly in drinking,
singing, and dancing, and never once thought
of winter.”</p>

<p>“If that be the case,” replied the Ant, “all
I have to say is that they who drink, sing,
and dance in summer must starve in
winter.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE commonwealth of Frogs, a discontented
race, weary of liberty and fond

them a King.</p>

<p>The good-natured deity, in order to grant
their request with as little mischief to them

splash sent them into the greatest terror and
amazement, and at first they regarded their
new monarch with great reverence and kept
at a respectful distance. But by degrees, perceiving
his amiable and peaceable disposition,
they gradually ventured to approach him with
more familiarity, till at length they conceived
for him the utmost contempt.</p>

<p>Dissatisfied with this state of things, they
renewed their request to Jupiter and entreated
him to bestow upon them another King.</p>

<p>In his wrath the Thunderer sent them a
Crane, who no sooner took possession of his
new dominion than he began to devour his
subjects, one after another.</p>

<p>They were now far more dissatisfied than
before. Applying to Jupiter a third time, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
were dismissed with the reproof that the evil
of which they complained they had imprudently
brought upon themselves; and that

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="62" height="75" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Mice, being sadly distressed on account
of their common enemy the Cat,
called a council to devise means of
ridding themselves of the annoyance. Many
plans were proposed and rejected, till at last
it was suggested by a young Mouse that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
bell should be hung round the Cat’s neck,
that having notice of her coming, they might
escape to their holes.</p>

<p>The proposal was hailed with applause and
agreed to unanimously. Whereupon an old
Mouse, who had sat in silence, got up and
said, “That is well, but who will bell the
Cat?” The Mice looked one at another, but
no one answered.</p>

<p>The old Mouse said, “It is easy to advise;
what is wanted is some one to act.”</p>

<h2>THE KID AND THE WOLF</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;KID, coming alone from its pasture,
was pursued by a Wolf. With great
presence of mind the kid turned and
said: “I know, Friend Wolf, that you mean
to kill me; but as my life is to be short, let
it be a merry one. Do you pipe and let me
have one more dance before I die.” While
the Wolf was piping and the Kid was dancing,
some Dogs, hearing the music, ran to
the place to see what was going on; and the
Wolf was glad to take himself off as fast as
his legs would carry him.</p>

<h2>THE HAWK AND THE NIGHTINGALE</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="62" height="75" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Nightingale, sitting aloft upon an
oak, was seen by a Hawk, who swooped
down and seized her. The Nightingale
earnestly prayed the Hawk to let her go, saying
that she was not big enough to satisfy the
hunger of a Hawk, who ought to find plenty
of larger birds. “Do you happen to see many
large birds flying about?” the Hawk asked.
“I should be foolish, indeed, to let you go for
the sake of larger birds that are not in sight.
A morsel is better than nothing.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE CROW AND THE PITCHER</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;CROW who was nearly perishing with
thirst spied a pitcher with a little
water in it. Reaching down, he found
the water so low that, stooping and straining
as he might, he was unable to reach it with
his beak. Thereupon he tried to overturn and
break the Pitcher. This he was not strong
enough to do. At last, seeing some small
pebbles, he brought a great many and dropped
them one by one, and so raised the water to
the brim and quenched his thirst.</p>

<h2>THE ANT AND THE DOVE</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-g.jpg" width="76" height="75" alt="G" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GOING to a fountain to quench his
thirst, an Ant tumbled in and was
ready to drown. But a Dove happened
to be perching on a neighboring tree
and saw the Ant’s danger. Plucking a leaf,
the Dove dropped it down into the water, so
that the Ant mounting upon it was blown
safely to the shore. A Fowler, shortly after,
spread his net to entrap the unwary Dove.
This the Ant perceived, and bit the Fowler’s
heel. Distracted by the pain, the Fowler
dropped his net with a quick start, and the
Dove, aroused to a sense of danger, flew away.</p>

<p>One good turn deserves another.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE OX AND THE FROG</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AN Ox, grazing in a swampy meadow,
chanced to set his foot among a number
of young Frogs and trampled
nearly all of them to death. One that escaped
ran off to his mother with the dreadful news.
“It was a beast—such a big four-footed
beast—that did it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Big?” asked the old Frog, and she puffed
herself out, “as big as this?”</p>

<p>“A great deal bigger,” said the little one.</p>

<p>“Well, was it so big?” and she swelled
herself out yet more.</p>

<p>“Indeed, Mother, but it was; and if you
were to burst yourself you would never reach
half its size.” Vexed that her child should
disparage her powers, the Mother Frog made
one more trial and burst herself indeed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE BAT AND THE WEASELS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;BAT, falling to the ground, was caught
by a Weasel, whom he entreated not
to take his life. The Weasel protested
that it was against nature for a weasel to
let a bird go. Whereupon the Bat insisted that
he was not a bird, and to prove it, called attention
to his mouselike head and ears, which so
confused the Weasel that he let the Bat go.</p>

<p>Some time afterward, on another flight, the
Bat fell again to the ground, and another
Weasel caught him. On perceiving that the
Weasel thought he was a mouse, the Bat contended
that he had wings and therefore was
not a mouse, and was again allowed to go free.</p>

<h2>THE FOX AND THE GOAT</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;FOX who had fallen into a deep well
was casting about to find how he
should get out again. At length a
Goat came to the place, and seeing Reynard,
asked whether the water was good, and if
there was plenty.</p>

<p>Hiding the real danger in his case, the Fox
replied: “The best in the world, and so much
of it that it cannot be exhausted. Come down
and see.” Whereupon the Goat jumped down
without more ado. Upon this the crafty Fox
jumped upon her horns and nimbly leaped out,
remarking to the deluded Goat, “If you had
brains to match your beard, you would have
looked before you leaped.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE WOMAN AND HER HEN</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;THRIFTY Woman kept a Hen that
could be depended on to lay an
egg every morning. The watchful
Woman thought within herself, “If I were
to double my Hen’s allowance of barley, she
would lay twice a day.” So she tried her plan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and the Hen became so fat and sleek that
she left off laying at all.</p>

<p>Thrift sometimes overreaches, and figures
are not always facts.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE DOG IN THE MANGER</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;DOG once made his bed in a manger
and lay there snarling and growling
at whoever came by. The Oxen coming
for their provender said: “What a miserable
cur! neither to eat the grain himself nor
to let any one else eat it!”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE MOUSE, THE FROG, AND
THE HAWK</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;MOUSE in an evil day made the acquaintance
of a Frog, and together
they set off on their travels. On
pretense of affection and of keeping his
companion safe from harm, the Frog tied
the Mouse’s forefoot to his own hind leg, and
thus they proceeded. It worked well enough
till they came to some water, and the Frog,
bidding the Mouse to have good courage,
plunged in and began to swim across. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
were barely halfway when the Frog took a
sudden plunge to the bottom, dragging the
unfortunate Mouse after him. But the struggling
of the Mouse made so great a commotion
in the water that it attracted the attention
of a Hawk, who, pouncing down and bearing
away the Mouse, carried the Frog also.</p>

<p>Alliances that are ill-matched generally end
in disaster; and the one who compasses the
destruction of his neighbor is often caught in
his own snare.</p>

<h2>THE SHEPHERD BOY AND THE WOLF</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;SHEPHERD boy, tending his flock
on the edge of a village, used to
amuse himself at times by crying
out, “Wolf! Wolf!” Twice or thrice his
trick succeeded. The whole village ran to
his assistance, only to be laughed at for their
pains. At last, one day, the Wolf came indeed.
The Boy cried out as before, and this
time in earnest. But the villagers, supposing
him to be at his old sport, paid no
heed to his cries, and the Wolf devoured
the sheep.</p>

<h2>THE FISHERMAN AND THE LITTLE FISH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AFTER toiling all day and catching
nothing, a Fisherman pulled up a
little Fish. The Fish besought him
to let him go, for he was small now, but by
and by he would grow to be a big fish and
so be worth catching. But the Fisherman answered,
“No, no, I have you now, it would
be foolish for me to let you go; I might not
get you when you had grown bigger.”</p>

<p>A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE FOX AND THE CROW</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;CROW snatched a piece of cheese out
of a window and flew with it up into
a tree, to eat it at leisure. A Fox
passing by chanced to look up and saw her.
He coveted the prize and thus made his
approaches to secure it. “O Crow,” said he,
“how beautiful are thy wings and how bright
are thine eyes! how graceful thy neck! What
a pity that such a bird should want only a
voice!” Yielding to the flattery, the Crow
opened her mouth to surprise the Fox with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
her caw, when down dropped the cheese, which
the Fox, snapping up, ate as he walked away,
remarking that whatever he had said of her
voice he did not say of her brains.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE PARTRIDGE AND THE FOWLER</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;PARTRIDGE, having been taken in
the net of a Fowler, cried out
piteously, “Spare me, good Master
Fowler, and I promise you, on my word, that I
will decoy other partridges into your net.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the man, “whatever I might
have done, I am determined now not to let
you go; for no death is too bad for one who
is ready to betray his friends.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE THIRSTY PIGEON</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;PIGEON, pressed by thirst and seeing
a glass of water painted on a sign,
supposed it to be real. Dashing
down at it with all her might, she struck
against the hard board, and breaking her
wing, she fell helpless to the ground and
was soon captured by one who passed by.</p>

<p>Great haste is not always good speed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE THREE TRADESMEN</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="62" height="75" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was a certain city in danger
of being besieged, and a council was
called accordingly, to consider the best
means of fortifying it. A Bricklayer gave his
judgment that no material was so good for
the purpose as brick. A Carpenter begged
leave to suggest that timber would be preferable,
upon which a Currier started up and
said, “Sirs, when all has been said that can be
said, there is nothing in the world like leather.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE HARES AND THE FROGS</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="29" height="75" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN DESPERATION over the hard times
they had on account of their many enemies,
the Hares came together and, after
rehearsing their situation, came to the sad
conclusion that nothing was left to them but
to drown themselves as the most miserable
and unfortunate of creatures. They repaired
to a pond to throw themselves off a rock into
the water and thus make an end of their
troubles. A shoal of frogs were sitting around
the edge of the pond, and at the approach of
the Hares they were startled, and with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
greatest confusion jumped into the water.
Whereupon the foremost of the Hares said to
his fellows: “Nay, then, friends, our case may
not be as desperate as we thought. Here are
other creatures more faint-hearted than are we.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE EAGLE AND THE FOX</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="78" height="75" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AN EAGLE and a Fox had lived together
as good neighbors, the former
on the summit of a high tree, the
latter in a hole at the foot of it. One day
when the Fox was abroad, the Eagle swooped
down and snatched the Fox’s cub and carried
it up to her nest, thinking that her high dwelling
made her secure from the Fox’s revenge.
The Fox returning upbraided the Eagle for
such a breach of confidence and begged to
have her young one returned to her. Finding
that her entreaties availed nothing, the Fox
snatched a brand from an altar fire which had
been lighted hard by and proceeded to involve
the whole tree in flames. The Eagle, to protect
her nest and her own young ones, restored
the cub to its mother, which she would not
do in answer to the most earnest entreaties.</p>
